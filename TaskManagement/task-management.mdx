# **OVERVIEW**

[Actionabl.ai](http://Actionabl.ai) is a platform that automates your business processes and alerts users whenever human intervention is needed. 

This guide covers Tasks reviewed and resolved by Business users, including:

- **User Tasks** - a task that must always be completed by a human, like reviewing a proof.
- **Quality Control (QC) Tasks** - a task whose output must be double-checked by a human, like issuing a payment to a vendor.

**Error tasks** may also be routed to a Business User when they involve business process errors, such as a missing document, a document that fails OCR because of poor scanning quality, or an invoice that fails content validation against business rules.

<Tip>
  If you are a new user of Actionabl, you should review [<u>Getting Started with Actionabl</u>](/GettingStarted/getting-started) to familiarize yourself with key concepts and terms used throughout this document.

# **PROCESSES AND TASKS**

There are three accordions in this section:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="The Process/Task/Stage Structure" description="Learn how the elements of a process come together and get organized into tasks" icon="arrow-progress">
    ## **The Process / Task / Stage Structure**

    Actionabl is all about automating your business **processes**. Those processes are composed of **tasks** that are grouped into **stages**. **Items** move through the process stages and are acted on within the tasks.

    Within your Actionabl account, you will likely have several automated processes. 

    While each process has its own flow and tasks, your dashboard and the modules show you an overview spanning all processes. Use filters and searches to narrow down the tasks shown, focus on a specific process, or locate a specific task or group of tasks.

    ### **_Processes_**

    A process is best visualized as a workflow with a clear starting point and a well-defined goal. It may contain branches of logic to account for decisions and conditions, or it might be a straight-through flow of information. 

    Here’s an example of a simple business process where a vendor sends an invoice, we validate the information and then record the payment or send a rejection notice.

    ![Bank Invoice Process Steps Pn](/images/BankInvoiceProcessSteps.png)

    A process always has:

    - A goal (process the invoice)
    - A status (pending, in progress, complete)
    - A starting point (vendor sends the invoice)
    - One or more stages (acknowledge, extract, validate, review, resolve)
    - One or more tasks within each stage (perform quality checks, validate the data, conduct a manual review)
    - A completion point (record the invoice or send a rejection email)

    When you begin working with Actionabl, our team works with your business to clearly define each process to be automated. We then implement (or work with your IT team to implement) the automation in our system. Integrations with your systems monitor and move items (such as emails, documents, purchase orders, and data) through the stages and tasks within the process. 

    When human intervention is needed along the way, the system creates alerts and provides the data and tools needed to resolve the alert and move the item along to the next step. There are two usual reasons for human intervention:

    - **A step in the process that cannot be automated**. This is typically an offline process, such as shipping a physical product or signing off on a proof. It can also include filing in missing form fields.
    - **An error during processing**. This could be business-related, such as a missing document or a poor-quality scan that can’t be read through OCR, or it could be a technical problem, like not getting a “success” message back from an API call to an integrated system.

    #### **Process Examples For Training**

    Throughout our guides and training, we use two process examples called **bank invoice processing** and **send notification**.

    The following sections describe these processes in common business terms and show how they are translated and displayed within Actionabl. While these are fictional and simplified processes, understanding how they are implemented in Actionabl will help you visualize how your own processes translate from real-world action to automation.

    #### **Bank Invoice Processing**

    **Goal**: Pay the vendor for their work and post the accounting in our systems. In most cases, this is where the process ends, but it can also end with an invoice being canceled, usually due to a mistake or dispute, in which case we also want to notify the vendor..

    **Business Users**: Accounting or financial staff, production management

    **Stages and Tasks:**

    - **Starting Point:** Invoice is received from a vendor who has produced and shipped a customer’s order, based on a Purchase Order the business sent to them.
    - **Acknowledge**
      - Send the vendor an acknowledgment that the invoice was received and will be processed.
    - **Extract**
      - Process the emailed invoice through OCR.
      - Read relevant data (vendor code, vendor name, date of invoice, list of items, etc.).
      - Store data in the database.
    - **Validate**
      - Does invoice data match basic requirements?
      - Is any required data missing?
      - Perform automated quality control checking.
    - **Review**
      - Does data meet the business rules or require intervention?
      - Does the invoice or data qualify for manual review?
    - **Resolve**
      - If the invoice is approved, 
        - enter it into the accounting system for payment
        - notify the vendor.
        - update the records for the invoice and its original purchase  order in the system
      - If the invoice is rejected, notify the vendor.

    **Business Rules**: 

    1. The invoice must be from a valid vendor and have appropriate dates (cannot be from future dates or dates older than 6 months in the past).
    2. Some invoices will always require special review:
       - If they are from certain vendors
       - If they exceed certain thresholds in size or scope.
    3. Some invoices will never require manual review:
       - If they are below a certain threshold
       - If they are from VIP vendors who are highly trusted

    When this process and its rules have been coded into Actionabl, it produces a process flow that looks like this in Process View:

    ![TMB1 Process Flow Jp](/images/TaskManagement/TMB1-ProcessFlow.jpg)

    **_Tasks_**

    A **task** is a single, specific action that occurs within the process. Tasks have a triggering event, item, action, outcome, and status. For example:

    The **Validate Invoice Data** task in the Bank Invoice process looks at the total amount, items, and quantity data from the invoice and ensures:

    1. If it’s a required field, it contains data
    2. The data in each field is in the correct format (number, text, currency, etc.)
    3. The data in each field is “valid,” if appropriate—for example, ZIP codes are validated against the USPS database, emails are in the appropriate format, vendor name and ID match against the company’s list of vendors, etc.

    A task always has:

    - **Triggering event**: Successful OCR scanning of invoice received from vendor
    - **Item**: Invoice
    - **Action**: Validate invoice data elements
    - **Outcome**: Invoice moves into an automated quality check
    - **Status**: Complete

    Within Actionabl, tasks can have the following types:

    | **Type**                  | **Definition**                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | **Icon**                             |
    | :------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :----------------------------------- |
    | **Decision**              | Assess whether a condition has been met, like checking whether an email has been received or if a value matches a criterion.                                                                                                          |                                      |
    | **User**                  | This task must always be completed by a human, like reviewing a proof or shipping a product. Your company may also define some types of errors to be user tasks, such as resolving an invoice that doesn’t match the expected amount. |                                      |
    | **Email**                 | This task sends an email, either internally or externally.                                                                                                                                                                            | ![Email Sv](/images/ICONS/Email.svg) |
    | **SMS**                   | This task sends an SMS text message.                                                                                                                                                                                                  | ![SMS Sv](/images/ICONS/SMS.svg)     |
    | **Chat**                  | This task reads or sends a message in a chat window.                                                                                                                                                                                  | ![SMS Sv](/images/ICONS/Chat.svg)    |
    | **Quality Control (QC)**  | A task that allows the output of the previous task to be double-checked by a human, like reviewing invoice data after it’s extracted by the OCR tool.                                                                                 | ![QC Sv](/images/ICONS/QC.svg)       |
    | **App**                   | Action taken by an external application, like sending email or creating a document.                                                                                                                                                   | ![AP Sv](/images/ICONS/AP.svg)       |
    | **OCR**                   | Optical character recognition to extract data from a scanned document.                                                                                                                                                                |                                      |
    | **RPA**                   | Robotic process automation to allow the software to mimic a human action in a web browser or desktop application, like filling in data in Quickbooks Online.                                                                          |                                      |
    | **Machine Learning (ML)** | Tasks completed by specialized apps, like face or voice recognition, that build the application’s knowledge for future tasks.                                                                                                         |                                      |
    | **Bot**                   | Automated, repetitive tasks like scheduling data backups or running a process at the same time every day.                                                                                                                             |                                      |
    | **SQL**                   | Tasks that interact with the database via reading, writing, or updating records.                                                                                                                                                      | ![Sql Sv](/images/ICONS/Sql.svg)     |
    | **Rule**                  | Validation of an item’s data against business rules and logical conditions.                                                                                                                                                           |                                      |
    | **Sub-Task**              | A task (or set of tasks) that is started within another task, like looking up a recipient’s full name so it can be included in an automated email.                                                                                    |                                      |
    | **ERROR**                 | A system-generated task alerting a user to a failure in processing an automated step correctly.                                                                                                                                       | N/A                                  |

    Examples of tasks:

    - **Extract invoice data**. Receives a PDF of an invoice and extracts the data from it. (_Automated_)
    - **Validate invoice data**. Compares the extracted invoice data to the business rules to determine if it’s correct, complete, and ready to process. (_Automated_)
    - **Quality control check**. Shows an accounting user a proposed vendor payment and its backing documents to determine if it is OK for payment by funds transfer. (_QC_)
    - **Resolve underwriting block**. Fill in missing data from a loan form after contacting the customer. (_User_)
    - **No response from API**. Alerts accounting that an invoice was sent to the Odoo API, but the system did not receive a “Success” response. (_Error_)

    ### **_Stages_**

    Within each process, tasks are grouped into **stages**, which makes it easier for people to understand and communicate about the progress of the task. 

    A stage may contain just one task or can loop through multiple tasks and logic branches. The key is that it represents a meaningful part of the overall process in the way human users visualize the process.

    <Tip>
      **NOTE: Stages are NOT the same as statuses**. Statuses communicate the progress of an item through the various tasks within the process and report on the success or failure of the task.  Stages are groupings of tasks within the process, like “validate” or “pay.”
    </Tip>
    Let’s look at part of the Bank Invoice Process example:

    - The “**Extract**” stage receives the invoice from the vendor via email and processes it through OCR to extract the data from the document, organize it, and save it into the database. This stage has a single OCR task.
    - The “**Validate**” stage in that flow first checks to make sure the invoice isn’t a duplicate or already paid or canceled, then does basic data validations on the invoice’s data fields. Once that’s complete, it moves the invoice into an automated Quality Control check to see whether it matches what was ordered, has the right unit prices, is billing for a correct quantity, and whether the total matches the allowed total for the PO. This stage has multiple Rules and Decisions, as well as the potential for User tasks.

  <Accordion title="Organizing Your Tasks" description="Learn about how tasks are grouped and move through processes" icon="sitemap">
    ## **Organizing Your Tasks**

    At any time, there are many items flowing through a process and its tasks and stages. In a typical workflow, you will only need to be aware of a few of them, so hiding the “noise” of the others is important. The modules and alerts in the dashboard are designed to help you focus on the items and tasks that require human attention, while letting all of the others flow through the automation without distraction.

    ### **_Dashboard View_**

    The Task Master dashboard in Actionabl is divided into four modules that organize your tasks, plus two search tools and a process view. It looks something like this:

    ![TMB2 Menu Jp](/images/TaskManagement/TMB2-Menu.jpg)

    As an item moves through the process flow and reaches a human task (User, QC, or Error), it creates an alert and places it in the appropriate module. A count of these tasks is shown in the colored bubble next to each module’s title; if there are none in that module, no bubble is shown.

    ### **_Task Statuses_**

    Tasks can have the following statuses:

    | **Status**      | **Meaning**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
    | :-------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | **Open**        | The task is actively in progress within the workflow. This includes not only active automation processes but also QC or User tasks that are waiting for human action.                                                                                                         |
    | **Error**       | Something unexpected has occurred in the process. This can be a system problem (such as a missing API response or a failed document upload) or a business rule failure (like invalid or missing data).                                                                        |
    | **Completed**   | The task was completed successfully. If this was done manually, it means that all automated steps in the process were either done manually or were not needed.                                                                                                                |
    | **Discarded**   | A user explicitly eliminated this item from the workflow.  For example, if the user processes invoices and “discards” one that is repeatedly erroring, that invoice is removed from the workflow.  The item is still visible under Active Search with the status “discarded.” |
    | **Resubmitted** | A user corrected an item’s data while processing an alert on this task and has resubmitted the item for automated execution.                                                                                                                                                  |

    ### **_Task Alerts_**

    As an item moves through the process, the system creates an alert when it reaches a task that requires human intervention (User, QC, or Error).

    <Tip>
      **HINT**: Regardless of where you view the alerts, you will only see tasks that are available to your user group.
    </Tip>
    #### **Modules and Alerts**

    Alerts are automatically sorted into their appropriate module on the dashboard. A count of these tasks across _all processes_ in the system is shown in the colored bubble next to each module’s title; if there are no tasks in that module, no bubble is shown.

    Alerts for tasks you’ve claimed or a manager has assigned to you appear in your **My Tasks** view. 

    To see all tasks in a module, click the module’s name or the bubble. Here’s an example of the Error Tasks list.

    ![TMB3 Error Task Queue Jp](/images/TaskManagement/TMB3-ErrorTaskQueue.jpg)

    **Process View Alerts**

    Task alerts are also shown on the Process View, where they use the same color-coded bubbles. The count of items shown in the Process View is not expected to match those in the sidebar for two reasons. The Process View bubbles:

    - Include <u>only</u> the alerts related to this specific process.
    - May also include items that are in queue for automated processing, such as when there is a backlog of items in a particular step. 

    ![TMB4 Processview Alerts Jp](/images/TaskManagement/TMB4-ProcessviewAlerts.jpg)

    Click any colored bubble on the Process View to see the items for that specific task <u>and</u> process.

    ![TMB5 Processalert Details Jp](/images/TaskManagement/TMB5-processalert-details.jpg)

    **_Communications Portal_**

    The Communications portal on the sidebar is where you’ll see various notifications from the system.

    ![TMB6A Communications Portal Jp](/images/TMB6A-CommunicationsPortal.jpg)

    - **Notifications** are the process notifications generated by automations in the system, as well as incoming emails.


    - **Threads** are internal messaging pertaining to specific tasks. They are also available in the Content & History section on the tasks themselves.
    - **Sent Mails** shows the history of email that you’ve sent through the system.

    ### **_Searching and Filtering_**

    It’s frequently helpful to be able to find a specific task or to narrow down a large list of tasks to ones that meet a set of criteria. Searching and filtering functions are designed to help you do this.

    On any list of task alerts, you’ll see Search and Filter icons at the top right of the list. These are the “**Quick**” options.

    On the dashboard’s menu, the Active Search and Archive Search are the “**Full**” search and filtering tools.

    ![TMB6A Typesofsearches Jp](/images/TaskManagement/TMB6A-typesofsearches.jpg)

    The scope of information searched by these tools differs.

    | **Quick Search and Filter**                                            | **Full Search and Filter**            |
    | :--------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------ |
    | Searches **only** the columns (fields) currently displayed on the list | Can search ALL columns in the record. |

    If a list being searched spans multiple pages of results, both the Quick and Full searches automatically look through all of the pages.

    #### **Searching and Filtering On Lists**

    Each list view has three or more functions to narrow down the results shown.

    **Overdue Only** is a toggle in the top center section. Turning it on immediately filters the results to show only items with a due date in the past.

    ![TMB8 Tasks Overdue Filter Jp](/images/TaskManagement/TMB8-TasksOverdueFilter.jpg)

    **Process Filter** is at the top right. Select a process from the list and it will only show tasks that are part of that process.

    ![TMB9 Process Filter Jp](/images/TaskManagement/TMB9-ProcessFilter.jpg)

    **Quick Search** is on the top right of each page. It is a dynamic and immediate search function that finds matches across all pages of the displayed list. You can use it in combination with the Process Filter or by itself. It shows matches immediately as you type.

    <Tip>
      **NOTE**: Quick Search only looks through the data in columns that are visually displayed in the list.
    </Tip>
    ![TMB10 Quick Table Search Jp](/images/TaskManagement/TMB10-QuickTableSearch.jpg)

    To **clear** a search term from these views, click the X in the box next to the term. For the Process Filter, you must hover over the field to see the X.

    ![TMB11 Clear Searches Jp](/images/TaskManagement/TMB11-ClearSearches.jpg)

    **Quick Filter** is on the top right of each task list. It helps you build more complex filters for the result set including boolean logic (AND/OR) conditions. If you have not yet specified a process in the Process Filter, you must select one here as the first step because the filterable fields available to you are process-specific.

    ![TMB12 Quick Filter Jp](/images/TaskManagement/TMB12-QuickFilter.jpg)

    ![TMB13 Filter Jp](/images/TaskManagement/TMB13-filter.jpg)

    When you’ve entered your criteria, click **Apply** at the top right to filter the list.

    ![TMB15 Filter Actions Jp](/images/TaskManagement/TMB15-FilterActions.jpg)

    **Full Searching and Filtering Tools**

    In the Dashboard menu, you’ll see **Active Search** and **Archive Search**, which are the “Full” versions of these tools. They enable you to search across processes, statuses, and types of tasks to create a customized list that you can interact with and/or download.

    These two tools act identically, with the exception that Archive Search looks only at data that is in an Archived state. Data is archived automatically based on how each process is defined and can also be manually archived. Archived data is _<u>not</u>_ included when you use Active Search and vice versa.

    The full search and filtering tools automatically look at all of the data fields stored for any item, regardless of that field’s display status. If a match is found, the item is included in the search results even if the field containing that data isn’t displayed on the list.

    The Search Tool has three tabs at the top: **Process Search**, **Task Search**, and **Custom Search**. By default, Process Search is displayed when you open the tool. These tabs specify the span of data to be searched - in all cases, what is returned is a list of tasks that match the criteria.

    ![TMB13 Filter Jp](/images/TaskManagement/TMB13-filter.jpg)

    Selecting a **Process Search** allows you to specify only a process and then other criteria at the process level.  Selecting **Task Search** lets you specify a specific task within a process, further narrowing the data returned. 

    **Custom Search** starts with a blank slate and enables you to build a complex query with boolean logic and save that query for future use.

    On the Process and Task Search tools, select <u>two or more</u> criteria (in addition to the Process) to use for searching. The screen matches against ALL criteria.

    <Tip>
      HINT: **Start with minimal criteria** and then add more if needed. This strategy helps you avoid missing any data by being too narrow with your search terms. If you are not sure what to use for your second criteria, consider Status or Created Date.
    </Tip>
    <Tip>
      HINT: **You must select two or more items in this section**. Criteria entered in the Advanced Options section do not count toward this minimum.
    </Tip>
    #### **Advanced Options**

    **Advanced Options** are available on both the Process Search and Task Search tabs once you select a process. If you need to narrow things down further or look for items that match a data point that is not shown at the top of the screen, click Advanced Options.

    ![TMB9A Advanced Search Jp](/images/TaskManagement/TMB9A-AdvancedSearch.jpg)

    This expanded view gives you access to <u>all</u> of the data fields available in the selected process, as well as the ability to build a more complex search query. 

    ![TMB9B Advanced Search Open Jp](/images/TaskManagement/TMB9B-AdvancedSearchOpen.jpg)

    **_Customizing the data displayed in results_**

    At the bottom of the screen is the **Display Columns** area containing a list of all of the fields, with checkboxes beside each one.

    1. Click the box beside each column to turn it on or off in the results display. You cannot change the order of the columns in the display.
    2. Click the reset icon on the gray Display Columns bar to reset the selection to default settings.

    **_Building a complex query_**

    The center section of the page is the **Data Filter** construction area, where you build more complex search queries.

    1. ![TMB13 Filter Criteria Jp](/images/TaskManagement/TMB13-FilterCriteria.jpg)

       Click the green plus box to add the **first query criterion**. Your screen should look  like this:

       ![TMB13A Inputfields Jp](/images/TaskManagement/TMB13A-Inputfields.jpg)
    2. Select the first field to be searched from the list in the **Field Name** box. This list contains all fields in the process selected at the top of the screen.
    3. Select the **Match Type**. The match type governs how the contents of the Field Name is compared with the data in the Match Value field. <u>The match types available relate directly to the type of data in the Field Name being searched</u>. 
       - **Text and ID fields** are expected to contain only letters and numbers. However, if numbers are present, they cannot be used in any math or processing. They might be a numeric ID or a SKU code, for example, but not a price or a date.\
         \
         Assume the data being searched is the following five records:\
           	_The Civil War\
          	Civility 101\
          	life as a civilan\
          	civil litigation\
         	civil_



    - **Numeric fields** contain only numbers, which may include decimals. The field cannot contain dollar signs or other currency symbols. The numbers may be positive or negative.

      Assume the data being searched is these four records:\
        	_10.00\
      	0.5897\
      	-130.45\
      	123_

    | **Less than or equal**    | The field’s value is either less than or equal to the Match Value.                                                                                                                                                                        | 10 - 125       | _10.00_  _0.5897_  _-130.45_        |
    | **Between**               | The field’s value must be between two values entered in the Match Value field.  The search considers the terms to be greater/less than or equal to the match value, so the values entered in the Match Value are included in the matches. | 10 - 125       | _10.00_  _123_                      |
    | **Is not null**           | The field contains any value.                                                                                                                                                                                                             | **BLANK**      | All records                         |
    | **Is null**               | The field is completely empty. It doesn’t contain spaces or invisible special characters.                                                                                                                                                 | **BLANK**      | Nothing found                       |

    - **Date fields **are special types of numeric fields that evaluate dates entered as _DD-MM-YYYY hh:mm aa_  (_Day-Month-Year hours:minutes am/pm_).
      - Hours are entered in 12-hour format (since AM/PM is appended to the string).
      - **You must specify a time in addition to a date**. To select a full day, use:

    **Start**           : DD-MM-YYYY 12:00 AM\
               **End**: DD-MM-YYYY 12:59 PM

    All dates in the system use the server’s **time zone** setting. This is set by your system administrator when they configure the environment. If you are not sure what the time zone is set to, please contact your admin, as it may differ from your local working time zone. (For example, you may work in Pacific time but the server is on Eastern time.)

    Assume the data being searched is these three records:\
      	_13-12-1968 09:26 AM\
    	07-07-2023 12:26 PM\
    	02-15-1995 01:47 PM_


    - **Boolean fields** allow only true-false content. You should not enter a Match Value for these fields. (For practical purposes, Yes = True, No = False)

    | **Selection**   | **Meaning**                              |
    | :-------------- | :--------------------------------------- |
    | **Is true**     | The field’s value is True.               |
    | **Is false**    | The field’s value is False.              |
    | **Is not null** | The field contains either True or False. |
    | **Is null**     | The field is completely empty.           |

    - Next, input the value to be searched for in the **Match Value** field.

    If you need additional criteria, click the green plus symbol to add another line, and build that criterion just as you did the first one. (You can continue clicking the plus and adding search criteria as needed.)

    <Tip>
      HINT: **The criteria in this section do not count toward the minimum of two items required for the search**. Select two or more items in the main Search section (above Advanced Options).
    </Tip>
    1. Indicate the way that these search phrases should be evaluated: as boolean **AND** or **OR** statements.\
       \
       Boolean**AND**  means that <u>both</u> searches must evaluate as TRUE, which translates to returning only the records that match both searches. **OR** means that <u>either</u> search can be TRUE, so it returns all results that match one or the other (or both) of the criteria. \
       \
       **Example**\
       Criteria 1 	    **Field Name**: Active   	 | 	**Match Type**: Is TRUE\
       Criteria 2 	**Field Name**: Due Date  | 	**Match Type**: Past Current Time\
       \
       **AND** returns all records that are Active and also have a Due Date that is past the current time.  \
       \
       **OR** returns all active records (including those with due dates in the past), as well as all records with future due dates (even if the record is Inactive).

    Click **Search **at the top right of the page to execute the Search. 

    **_Query Grouping (Grouped Conditions)_**

    You can build increasingly complex queries by using **query grouping**.

    Click the **group** button and the system will add a box to build a nested group of query criteria.  

    To better visualize how to use this, consider the following goal.  

    Find all invoices in the system that meet the following criteria:

    - Haven’t been paid
    - Are dated as received within the last 30 days
    - Originate with vendors A or B and are greater than $1000, **OR **originate with vendors C or H and are greater than $5000

    We would group these conditions like this:

    ```
    (Invoice = unpaid) AND
    
    (Invoice age >= 30 days) AND
    
    [ (Vendor = A) OR (Vendor = B) AND amount > $1000 ]	OR
    
    [ (Vendor = C) OR (Vendor = H) AND amount > $5000 ]
    ```

    Query groups are most useful in two circumstances:

    - You need to mix AND and OR statements within a larger set of criteria, such as the differing monetary thresholds for vendors here.
    - You have many criteria, and grouping may give you some efficiency in organizing or managing the data.

    ## ![Tmb99 Criteria Group Jp](/images/tmb99-CriteriaGroup.jpg)

    **_Task Lists_**

    Task lists are where you select, view, and act on tasks. All the matching items are presented in a table.

    #### **Sorting Task Lists**

    By default, tasks are sorted with the highest priority at the top of the list (as shown by the up-arrow next to Priority in the column name) and then by their ID in ascending order. 

    You can sort “up” or “down” by any column by clicking on the column’s name at the top. You will then see an arrow by the column name indicating that it’s the sort column (and the sort direction).

    ![Tmb17tasklistsort Jp](/images/TaskManagement/TMB17tasklistsort.jpg)

    **Overdue Only**

    You can quickly view only overdue items by toggling the **Overdue Only** button in the top center of the page.

    ![TMB18 Overdue Only Jp](/images/TaskManagement/TMB18-OverdueOnly.jpg)

    **Bulk Actions**

    The Bulk Actions toggle turns on the ability to select multiple items from the list and take action on all of them at once. Details on this function are found under **Taking Action on Tasks**. 

    #### **Auto-load Tasks**

    The **Auto-load Tasks** toggle in the top center of the page turns on the ability for you to page through all of the detail pages for the tasks on the list without returning to the list view to select the next task.

    ![TMB19 Auto Loadtasks Jp](/images/TaskManagement/TMB19-Auto-loadtasks.jpg)

    1. Click to turn on**Auto-load Tasks** .
    2. Click the first task you want to see. Its details screen opens.
    3. Besides the regular action items in the menu, you’ll see a **Skip** button. Click that button to load the next task from the list.
    4. ![TMB20 Task Skip Jp](/images/TaskManagement/TMB20-TaskSkip.jpg)

       After scrolling through tasks, click **Close** to return to the task list.
