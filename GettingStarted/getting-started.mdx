# **OVERVIEW**

[Actionabl.ai](http://Actionabl.ai) is a platform that automates your business processes and alerts users whenever human intervention is needed. 

To get started, your team will work with Actionabl to define the business processes, artifacts (documents and records), and workflows. The Actionabl team (or your IT team) then implements those processes and artifacts into the platform on your behalf and then tests that implementation with your team. 

When you begin using the platform in production, it’s pre-populated with your data and process – all you need to do is respond to alerts and (if you’re an admin) make minor adjustments.

# **KEY CONCEPTS AND TERMS**

## **Alerts**

Actionabl alerts users whenever a process needs human intervention. This happens in two cases:

- **A step in the process that cannot (or should not) be automated**. For example, one of your vendors may require payment using a non-standard method such as a physical check, or a printing process might need an expert to review and sign off on a proof. This also includes quality checks and review steps.
- **An error in an automated step**. For example, automation reconciles a vendor’s invoice against your purchase order and applies specific business rules; when the invoices fails reconciliation, your invoice manager needs to review and investigate before payment can proceed. This case also covers when something goes wrong, such as Actionabl not getting a response from an integrated system or encountering a missing document in a task step.

## **Users**

### User Types

The Actionabl system has two user classifications: Business and Technical. 

- **Business Users** handle tasks such as quality assurance, offline process steps, and issues related to the “content” of your business process. They are generally not in charge of managing a function or technical component of the system.

Examples:  Accounts receivable associates, production coordinators, customer support representatives, sales team, and quality assurance specialists.

- **Technical Users** monitor the operation of the processes and the system itself and respond to errors that indicate something may not work correctly. For example, they resolve error codes or investigate the lack of a success response from an API call. Technical users may also take a proactive role in configuring parts of the workflow or user notifications. 

Examples:  Process managers, system engineers, manufacturing plant managers, and system administrators.

### User Groups

When your administrator sets up your login, they assign it to one or more “groups” in the system. Your group assignment sets the boundaries for what you see by default and what you can access within the system.

Your group helps you avoid noise associated with tasks that don’t relate to your role. For example, if you are in the Accounting group, you won’t see tasks or alerts relating to manufacturing processes. 

### Departments

Your team may also use Departments to group users and manage their permissions. Departments, like groups, are granted the rights to certain assets in the system. They can also be used for notifications through a shared email address like "[support@yourcompany.com](mailto:support@yourcompany.com)" or "[hr@yourcompany.com](mailto:hr@yourcompany.com)".

## **Dashboards**

The Actionabl platform has two primary user dashboards: **Task Master** and **Controller**. An **Admin** dashboard is also available only to admin-level users; its use is covered in the System Administration guide.

Certain users have access to specialty dashboards for **Design** (process design, component design, control center, and admin controls) and **Automation Builder**, **Accelerator**, and **Dev Tools,** which are documented in their individual user guides.

### Task Master

The Task Master dashboard clearly focuses users on the tasks flowing through the workflow. It alerts users to any action needed to resolve an error or complete an offline business process.

Task Master is organized into modules for each type of task (user, error, etc.) and has robust search and filtering capabilities. It also has the “My Tasks” module, where a user can access all tasks that are assigned to them. 

**_User Types:_**  Business and Technical Users

  **The Task Master dashboard and its functionality is covered in detail in the Task Management Guide.**

### Controller

The Controller dashboard manages workflow elements such as scheduling and task configuration. It also contains reporting, analytics, and a module for accessing and resolving Error Reports. Like Task Master, it offers robust searching and filtering.

## **Process View**

The Process View is a special way of looking at a workflow and its components like stages and tasks.

A **process** is a complete end-to-end workflow that accomplishes a set of goals. Here's an example:

<Card title="Bank Invoice Process" icon="sparkles">
  The **Bank Invoice Process** starts with receiving an invoice from a vendor, extracting its data, validating that invoice against purchase order data and a set of business rules, sending it for possible user review by the Accounts Payable team, then recording it in the accounting system or sending a rejection email if it doesn't meet requirements
</Card>

Within a process, there are typically multiple **stages**.  A stage is a group of tasks that loop through a meaningful part of the process. Using the Bank Invoice Process example:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Extract Stage" icon="sparkles">
    The **Extract** stage takes the invoice document and runs it through OCR to pull the relevant data, organize it, and save it for the next step in the process to use
  </Card>
  <Card title="Validate Stage" icon="sparkles">
    The **Validate** stage then compares that data to a set of business rules to ensure it matches what was ordered, what you agreed to pay, the status of the items ordered, and so on. If discrepancies are found, this stage might include a human quality control check on the invoice.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Each stage contains one or more **tasks**, the core elements of all workflows. A task may be executed by a system, application, or human, but it always has some action (and status) associated with it. For example:

<Card title="Validate Invoice Data Task" icon="sparkles">
  The **Validate Invoice Data** task in the Validate stage looks at the total amount, items, and quantity data from the invoice and compares it to the data in the purchase order sent to the vendor. If it matches, that task is complete, and the process moves on to the next step. If it doesn’t match, the task creates a new QA Task for the accounts payable team to resolve.
</Card>

The Process View module provides a visual way of understanding the flow within a process, showing these stages and tasks as a flowchart.
