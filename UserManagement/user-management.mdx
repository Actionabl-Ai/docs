# **OVERVIEW**

[Actionabl.ai](http://Actionabl.ai) is a platform that automates your business processes and alerts users whenever human intervention is needed. 

This guide covers User Management Tasks usually performed by administrators or supervisory users, including:

- **Managing Assets** - Assets are the granular tasks, items, dashboards, and resources within the system. They are the key to managing permissions throughout the system.
- **Managing Groups and Departments** - Groups and Departments are the ways we grant or restrict permissions to multiple users at a time, ensuring the integrity of the data in the system.
- **Managing Users** - Adding and deleting users and changing their permissions as their responsibilities change is a common task of supervisors and admins.

# **UNDERSTANDING USER MANAGEMENT**

Supervisory employees may have permissions in the Actionabl system to manage the users in their organization. This is done on the **Admin dashboard** in your account.

User permissions include:

- Adding, editing, or deactivating a user
- Assigning or removing a user to a user group or assigning them to a department
- Editing information for a user group or department, such as contact information and naming
- Changing the menus, actions, and portals (collectively called “assets”) available to a user group
- Deactivating a user group or department

<Info>
  **Note**: Creating a new user group or department is available only to users with Super Auth group permissions.
</Info>

<Info>
  **Note**: You can edit all of the information for a user that you have created. For users created by someone else, you can change the User Group assignments. System-created users (which have  a “last-updated by” user of “Actionabl") cannot be changed.
</Info>

## **Accessing the Admin Dashboard**

User functions are found under “Access Control” on the Admin dashboard in your account. 

1. Click the up-arrow **^** next to your name in the bottom left corner of the screen. This will open your Profile menu.\
   ![UM1 Adminuseraccess1 Jp](/images/UserManagement/UM1-Adminuseraccess1.jpg)
2. Select **Admin** at the top of that menu. This is how you move between different dashboards that are available to your user. (Only the dashboards that you have permission to use are shown on your list.)
3. Click **Admin Controls**, then select **Access Control** to manage users and groups.\
   ![/images/UserManagement/UM3-accesscontrol.jpg\+\_existingInIndexedDbMintlify](/images/UserManagement/UM3-accesscontrol.jpg)
4. When you open Access Control, you see four tabs across the top: **User**, **Group**, **Department**, and **Asset**.\
   ![UM4 Accesscontroltabs Jp](/images/UserManagement/UM4-accesscontroltabs.jpg)

- **User**: Add, edit, activate, and deactivate user accounts in the system. This is the default tab when you click Access Control.
- **Group**: You can edit or deactivate a group and assign users to it, which allows for cross-department permissions or process routing. For Authorization groups, this is also where you specify which assets the group can access.
- **Department**: Create or edit a department, assign users to the department, and set a department as being active or inactive.
- **Asset**: Create a new asset and manage the groups that can access the asset. Assets can be actions, menus, processes, or portals.

## **Understanding Groups, Departments, and Users**

When putting together the access plan for your business, we build it based on a set of assets, which are then put into groups and departments. Users have groups and (sometimes) departments assigned to them.

This looks something like this:

![/images/CHARTS/CHART-accesscontrolschema.jpg\+\_existingInIndexedDbMintlify](/images/CHARTS/CHART-accesscontrolschema.jpg)

In this access plan, 

- User 1 has access only in Process 2, where they have fairly restrictive (green) user tasks (searching and claiming tasks). Their Marketing department role also gives them a supervisory task (managing attachments).
- User 2 has access in both processes. They have a (blue) supervisory task (managing attachments) and can also claim and search. 
- User 3 only can claim and search, but they can do it in both processes

This arrangement enables us to create a granular set of permissions so users see and can act on only the items within their assigned roles.

## **Understanding Assets**

Assets are the actions, menus, processes, portals, and spaces within the system. The Assets menu enables you to assign or restrict specific assets to specify what a User Group's members can do.

![/images/UserManagement/UM24-addingasset.jpg\+\_existingInIndexedDbMintlify](/images/UserManagement/UM24-addingasset.jpg)

Select the **Asset Type** from the dropdown, then give it a human-friendly name. Click **Save** to save it.

Simply creating an asset in the list does <u>not</u> cause any access or restriction to happen. This simply maps the access name to a group. 

Work with your system administrator to define the action that the asset takes. The administrator will create the necessary rules and code.

# **MANAGING GROUPS**

There are three types of Groups: **Authorization** and **Task**.

- **Authorization** groups allow a user to access a dashboard in the system, such as TaskMaster or Controller. A user account must have at least one of these groups to log in.
- **Communication** groups determine whether the user can receive notifications and/or see communications via Threads.
- **Task** groups specify the tasks and modules that the user can access.

**Only users who are members of the Super Auth group can edit a group’s assets or add a new group to the system**. Other Supervisory users can see which assets the group can use and can add or remove users from the group.

Each system has certain pre-defined groups; your administrator may add more but cannot delete these groups.

| **Predefined Group** | **Type**      | **Permissions**                                                                                                                                                  |

   ![UM8 Searchanddownload Jp](/images/UserManagement/UM8-searchanddownload.jpg)
5. Click **Close** to return to the list of groups without saving any changes made on this list.

### **_Changing the Users Assigned To a Group_**

You can add or remove users from a group by using the Group Users function.

1. Click the expander icon next to the group to open its details.\
   ![/images/UserManagement/UM5-Groupdef1.jpg\+\_existingInIndexedDbMintlify](/images/UserManagement/UM5-Groupdef1.jpg)
2. Click **Group Users** to open the list of all system users. For convenience, all users currently assigned to this group are checked and listed at the top of the list.\
   ![/images/UserManagement/UM9-selectuser.jpg\+\_existingInIndexedDbMintlify](/images/UserManagement/UM9-selectuser.jpg)

   <Tip>
     **NOTE**: Pagination is found at the bottom right if the list is long enough to need it.
   </Tip>
3. Check to add or un-check to remove users from this group.
4. If the user you need to add is not yet in the system:
   - Click the green plus button at the top right to add them to the list.\
     ![/images/UserManagement/UM15-Creatinganewuser.jpg\+\_existingInIndexedDbMintlify](/images/UserManagement/UM15-Creatinganewuser.jpg)
   - Click **Save** when you have added their information, including their password.
   - The new user is now shown at the top of the list. Click the checkbox to add them to the group.
5. Click **Save** at the top right of the popup to save the changes to the group.

# **MANAGING DEPARTMENTS**

Departments are groups of users who share similar sets of responsibilities and interests, such as customer support, human resources, or operations. They are likely to need access to the same processes and items, but individuals may also need different accesses. 

For example:

- All members of the auditing department have full access to quality control tasks.
- Members of the auditing department who are in the Supervisors group also have access to the user management tasks and options in the system.

**Only users who are members of the Super Auth group or the Actionabl team can edit a department’s information or add a new department to the system**. Other Supervisory users can add or remove users from the department.

Departments are managed on the **Admin** dashboard under **Access Control**, in the **Department** tab.

![/images/UserManagement/UM10-DepartmentsList.jpg\+\_existingInIndexedDbMintlify](/images/UserManagement/UM10-DepartmentsList.jpg)

Click the expand icon to access its list of assigned users. The department’s name, email, phone, and active status are not editable here.

![/images/UserManagement/UM11-departmentusersbutton.jpg\+\_existingInIndexedDbMintlify](/images/UserManagement/UM11-departmentusersbutton.jpg)

![/images/UserManagement/UM12-listofdepartmentusers.jpg\+\_existingInIndexedDbMintlify](/images/UserManagement/UM12-listofdepartmentusers.jpg)

To add a new department, click the green plus sign at the top right of the department list.

![/images/UserManagement/UM13-adddept.jpg\+\_existingInIndexedDbMintlify](/images/UserManagement/UM13-adddept.jpg)

Once you click **Save**, you can add users to the department. Because you created this department, you can also edit its name, email, phone number, and active status.

![/images/UserManagement/UM14-savednewdept.jpg\+\_existingInIndexedDbMintlify](/images/UserManagement/UM14-savednewdept.jpg)

# **ADDING, EDITING, & DEACTIVATING USERS**

### **_Duplicating A User_**

This function makes an exact copy of an existing user and copies their permissions, groups, or departments over. 

1. Click the expand icon to the right of the existing user you wish to duplicate. This opens their details.\
   ![/images/UserManagement/UM16-DuplicateUser1.jpg\+\_existingInIndexedDbMintlify](/images/UserManagement/UM16-DuplicateUser1.jpg)
2. Click the green **Duplicate** button. The original user record closes on the list and a new copy is open immediately below it. The original is now listed just above the gray box and all of its information has been copied into the new user in the gray box, which now also shows the Password field.\
   ![/images/UserManagement/UM17-duplicate1.jpg\+\_existingInIndexedDbMintlify](/images/UserManagement/UM17-duplicate1.jpg)
3. Change the information in the **User ID**, **User Name**, and **Email** fields. Also update the phone fields, if necessary.\
   ![/images/UserManagement/UM18-DuplicateUser2.jpg\+\_existingInIndexedDbMintlify](/images/UserManagement/UM18-DuplicateUser2.jpg)
4. Enter a temporary password for the new user (they will be required to change it the first time they log in).
5. If the new user is to be active immediately, make sure **Active** is clicked. 
6. Click **Save** to create the new user account. You’ll now see all of this user's setting options.\
   ![/images/UserManagement/UM19-Duplicateuser3.jpg\+\_existingInIndexedDbMintlify](/images/UserManagement/UM19-Duplicateuser3.jpg)
7. The new user is now listed and can log in with the same permissions and groups as the one they were copied from.
8. To change the new user’s permissions, start by clicking **User Groups** and assign them to all of the groups they need. Consult your system administrator, human resources, and/or their manager to determine the appropriate settings for them. Click **Save** after making your selections.

There are three types of user groups:

- **Authorization**:  These groups determine which dashboards the user can see.

<Tip>
  **NOTE**: Users must have at least one “Authorization” group to allow them to log in. Otherwise, they will receive an error message:

  ![images/UM_user-unauthorized.jpg](/images/UM_user-unauthorized.jpg)
</Tip>

- **Communication**:  These groups determine whether the user can receive notifications and/or see communications via Threads.
- **Task**:  This is the most granular level of group permissions. It specifies the types of tasks that the user can see and engage with.  If you do not select tasks, you will see the dashboard, but it will be empty.

\
This is an example of a typical “routine business user” setting:

![/images/UserManagement/UM20-Adddepartments.jpg\+\_existingInIndexedDbMintlify](/images/UserManagement/UM20-Adddepartments.jpg)

1. Click on **User Departments** to adjust the user’s assignment to a Department. As with Groups, consult with the appropriate staff to determine which one(s) to assign.  Make sure to click **Save** after making your selections.\
   ![/images/UserManagement/UM26-Select-department.jpg\+\_existingInIndexedDbMintlify](/images/UserManagement/UM26-Select-department.jpg)
2. After adding the groups and departments, click the gray CANCEL button to return to the list of users. The new user appears just under the original one.

<Tip>
  **Note:** Your username is listed under “Updated By” indicating that you are the last person who made changes to their account. When they subsequently update their password, their name will appear here instead.
</Tip>

![/images/UserManagement/UM22-Newuserinlist.jpg\+\_existingInIndexedDbMintlify](/images/UserManagement/UM22-Newuserinlist.jpg)

**_Adding A User From Scratch_**

This process is used to add a new user account that is not modeled after an existing account.

1. Click the green plus button at the top right of the screen to open the new user form.\
   ![/images/UserManagement/UM21-blankuserform.jpg\+\_existingInIndexedDbMintlify](/images/UserManagement/UM21-blankuserform.jpg)
2. Fill in a **User ID**, which becomes the user’s login. This must: 
   - be unique 
   - contain only alphanumeric characters, plus underscore (\_) or dash (-). 
   - cannot contain spaces. 
   - The user ID cannot be changed once the record is saved.
3. Enter the user’s name in the **User Name** field. This is the name displayed on their Profile and anywhere they are listed in the data. It is not the user id they use to log in, so it can be changed at any time by the user or an administrator.
4. If the new user is to be active immediately, make sure **Active** is clicked. 
5. Enter the **email address** at which the user should receive system notifications. 
6. Enter their **phone number**. The system will use this number to send SMS notifications. The phone number can be entered using \+, ( ), and -, but these are not required. Long-form phone numbers like \+1 (800) 555-5555 can be used.
7. Enter a **temporary password** for the new user (they will be required to change it the first time they log in).
8. **Leave the Skills field empty**. This is reserved for future functionality.
9. Click **Save** to create the new user account. You’ll now see all of the options to change this user's settings.\
   ![/images/UserManagement/UM28-editinguser.jpg\+\_existingInIndexedDbMintlify](/images/UserManagement/UM28-editinguser.jpg)

**_The new user is now listed but they are not yet able to log in as they have no permissions in the system._**

Start by clicking **User Groups** and assign them to all of the groups they need. Consult your system administrator, human resources, and/or their manager to determine the appropriate settings for them. Click **Save** after making your selections.

There are three types of user groups:

- **Authorization**:  These groups determine which dashboards the user can see.

<Tip>
  **NOTE**: Users must have at least one “Authorization” group to allow them to log in. Otherwise, they will receive an error message:\
  ![/images/UM_user-unauthorized.jpg\+\_existingInIndexedDbMintlify](/images/UM_user-unauthorized.jpg)
</Tip>

- **Communication**:  These groups determine whether the user can receive notifications and/or see communications via Threads.
- **Task**:  This is the most granular level of group permissions. It specifies the types of tasks that the user can see and engage with.  If you do not select tasks, you will see the dashboard, but it will be empty.\
  \
  This is an example of a typical “routine business user” setting:

![/images/UserManagement/UM20-Adddepartments.jpg\+\_existingInIndexedDbMintlify](/images/UserManagement/UM20-Adddepartments.jpg)

1. Click on **User Departments** and assign the user to one or more departments. As with Groups, consult with the appropriate staff to determine which one(s) to assign.  Make sure to click **Save** after making your selections.\
   ![/images/UserManagement/UM26-Select-department.jpg\+\_existingInIndexedDbMintlify](/images/UserManagement/UM26-Select-department.jpg)
2. After adding the groups and departments and saving them in the popup, click the gray CANCEL button to return to the list of users. The new user will appear just under the original one.\
   ![/images/UserManagement/UM22-Newuserinlist.jpg\+\_existingInIndexedDbMintlify](/images/UserManagement/UM22-Newuserinlist.jpg)

<Tip>
  **HINT**: As a best practice when setting up users from scratch, log in as the user after you create their account to ensure that it is properly set up and has access to the functionality and tasks that you expect it to. (You will need to change the default password when you do this.)
</Tip>

### **_Editing A User_**

You can edit a user's information if you created the user or are a member of the Super Auth group.

| **Fields That Can Be Edited** | **Supervisor** | **Super Auth User** |

1. Click on the expand icon next to the user you want to edit.
2. You will see all of the fields available to you. Click the purple **Edit** button to make the fields editable.\
   ![/images/UserManagement/UM28-editinguser.jpg\+\_existingInIndexedDbMintlify](/images/UserManagement/UM28-editinguser.jpg)
3. Make the changes you want, then click the green **Save** button.\
   ![/images/UserManagement/UM29-edituser2.jpg\+\_existingInIndexedDbMintlify](/images/UserManagement/UM29-edituser2.jpg)
4. Make any needed changes to their user groups, department, or password, then click CANCEL to close their details. The changes are now saved and will appear wherever this user’s information is displayed in the system.
