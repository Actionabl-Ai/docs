# **OVERVIEW**

[Actionabl.ai](http://Actionabl.ai) is a platform that automates your business processes and alerts users whenever human intervention is needed. 

This guide covers User Management Tasks usually performed by administrators or supervisory users, including:

- **Managing Assets** - Assets are the granular tasks, items, dashboards, and resources within the system. They are the key to managing permissions throughout the system.
- **Managing Groups and Departments** - Groups and Departments are the ways we grant or restrict permissions to multiple users at a time, ensuring the integrity of the data in the system.

**Managing Users** - Adding and deleting users and changing their permissions as their responsibilities change is a common task of supervisors and admins.

# **MANAGING USERS**

Supervisory employees may have permissions in the Actionabl system to manage the users in their organization. This is done on the **Admin dashboard** in your account.

User permissions include:

- Adding, editing, or deactivating a user
- Assigning or removing a user to a user group or assigning them to a department
- Editing information for a user group or department, such as contact information and naming
- Changing the menus, actions, and portals (collectively called “assets”) available to a user group
- Deactivating a user group or department

<Info>
  **Note**: Creating a new user group or department is available only to users with Super Auth group permissions.
</Info>

<Info>
  **Note**: You can only edit information for a user that you have created, but you can change the User Group assignments on any user other than those created by the system. These users have a “last-updated by” user of “Actionabl.”
</Info>

## **Accessing the Admin Dashboard**

User functions are found under “Access Control” on the Admin dashboard in your account. 

1. Click the up-arrow **^** next to your name in the bottom left corner of the screen. This will open your Profile menu.
