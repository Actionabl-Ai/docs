# **MANAGING AUTOMATIONS, TASKS, RULES, AND APPS**

**If you are a Supervisory or Administrative user**, you likely have access to manage certain things about the **tasks** that are flowing through a process and the **rules, apps, connectors, **and**automations**  within that process. Some non-admin users may also have been granted the right to edit some of these items.

Most of the tasks in this guide are accessed through the **Process View **(which is available on many dashboards).

## **Management Functions**

- The**Automation tasks**  screen displays and manages the status of the tasks that keep items flowing through the process.
- **Task Management** lets you:
  - Set a task to Active or Inactive.
  - Configure the Service Level Agreement (SLA) for this task. Violations of the SLA generate alerts to certain users so problems can be fixed.
  - Specify automated assignments of tasks to a workgroup or user.
  - Configure all types of notifications that can be triggered by this task, including the contents and templates for each notification.
- **Rules Management **configures the rules that guide how data is validated as it flows through the task, including the error messages generated by them.
  - The **Decision Model** is where the business logic for rules can be adjusted.
- **App Connector **shows and lets you adjust how a connector is used within the process. 

## **Accessing Process Management Functions**

Process management functions are all accessed through the**Process View** . 

**Each process is managed separately**, and your user group grants you permission to perform these tasks on a process-specific basis.

To access management functions:

1. Click **Process View** in the dashboard to access the module.\

# **Automation Management**

Automations are the heart of a process; they are the elements that move items through the tasks without human intervention.

However, there are times when something needs adjustment or goes wrong. The Automation Manager is where you’ll manage and resolve those cases by starting, stopping, or restarting processes.

Open the **Automation Manager**. You’ll see a pop-up listing all automations in the current process. An asterisk (\*) in the Process Name or Task Name field indicates that the automation spans all processes or all tasks in this process, respectively.

- Sort by clicking any column’s header.
- Search the list using the search field in the top right.
- Close the list by clicking Close at the top right.

![ATR09 Automationmanagerwithitempaused Jp](/images/AutomationTaskRules/ATR09-Automationmanagerwithitempaused.jpg)

For each automation, you can see its **Status** in the Status field and start or stop it. **Last Run** is the date and time on which the automation was last started.

1. **Running**: the automation is currently running correctly.
2. **Paused**: a user has clicked the pause button and the automation is not currently active. When changing ANY process rule or task configuration, you should first Pause the process and then restart it once your changes are complete. This activates your changes for all future (and queued) items.\
   _A status of Paused does <u>not</u> indicate an error state._ \
   Click the red button to continue running the process where it left off.
3. **Failed**: This should be exceptionally rare, but indicates that something has gone wrong in the system or automation causing it to fail. \
   Contact your system administrator or Actionabl support for help.
4. **Pausing** / **Resuming**: These are temporary statuses that you’ll see for a few seconds while the automation is in the process of pausing or restarting.
5. **Restart** This stops and then restarts the process to ensure any updates are made. If you click this, you’ll receive a popup to confirm your action:

# **Task Management**

The Task Management pop-up is where you can view the task details in the process and edit some of the task's components.

As each type of task (user, QC, error, global) in a process differs in its design and the scope of data that it handles, the actual fields shown will be different.

<Tip>
  **HINT**: When you click on “View Task Management” while hovering over a specific task, the pop-up appears with that task already expanded. The other tasks in the process are collapsed.  If you access Task Management by clicking <u>outside</u> of a task, the first task in the process is expanded by default.

</Tip>

### **_Global Task Settings_**

Settings that apply across the process as a whole are “global” task management settings, indicated by an asterisk (\*) in the Task Name field.

![ATR11 Globaltasks Jp](/images/AutomationTaskRules/ATR11-Globaltasks.jpg)

Click on the expand icon on the far right to open the task if it isn’t already open. 

- To change the information, click the blue **Edit** button at the bottom right. When you are in Edit Mode, that button changes to a green **Save** button.
- To collapse the task and return to the list without saving any changes, click **Cancel**.

![ATR12 Global Task Settings Jp](/images/AutomationTaskRules/ATR12-GlobalTaskSettings.jpg)

### **Process Information**

The top section is **Process Information**, showing the process’ display name, task name, Active status and SLA (Service Level Agreement).

![ATR13 Process Settings Jp](/images/AutomationTaskRules/ATR13-ProcessSettings.jpg)

- **This pop-up shows the Process and Task Names but does not allow editing of them. **Only administrators can change a process or task name. 


- **Active** turns a task on or off for execution. If you turn this off for a Global task, it will attempt to default to the next-higher level of process configuration (system -\> process -\> task -\> sub-task).
- The **Process SLA** is the service-level agreement that sets the expectation for how long the process takes to complete. In the case of a global setting, this is the completion window expected for the <u>entire process</u>. Exceeding this window causes the task status to display as OVERDUE, and the due date will show in red. \
  \
  This is entered as:  _dd:HH:mm_ (days:hours:minutes). \
  Examples:
  - 1.5 hours: 00:01:30
  - 1 day and 8 hours: 01:08:00
  - 5 days:  05:00:00
- The **Notification Workgroup** and **Thread Workgroup** settings specify the groups that are notified when the SLA is violated.

### **Error Handling**

The **Error Handling** section specifies how any error condition that occurs during the entire process is assigned and alerted.

![ATR14 Errortaskassignment Jp](/images/AutomationTaskRules/ATR14-Errortaskassignment.jpg)

**Workgroup** sets the User Group(s) who can see and access the error task. Typically, your administrator will have created an error-handling group that is a subset of the users for this process.

- **Reassign to Last User** is a checkbox to automatically assign an error task to the last user who claimed or was assigned this same type of error task. 
- **User** lets you select a specific user to always be assigned this error task.
- **Auto Assign** assigns the task to the user with the fewest current assignments, who is available, and who also belongs to the group assigned to the task.

### **Task Notification**

The **Tasks Notification** section is where you configure all <u>non-error</u> alerts and notifications, as well as the content and templates used for them.

<Tip>
  **HINT**: Global notifications are sent routinely across ALL tasks in this workflow, so they are sent out every time an item moves between task steps. If you prefer to have users notified only when items move into certain steps (like user tasks or QC tasks), <u>do not</u> use global notifications; use User Tasks for that instead.
</Tip>

![ATR15 All Tasknotifications Jp](/images/AutomationTaskRules/ATR15-AllTasknotifications.jpg)

The first line selects which **types of tasks** should receive notifications: Error, User, and/or QC.

- Next, indicate the **type(s) of notifications** the system should send: Email, SMS, and/or WhatsApp messages.
- The **Recipient Email** and **Phone Number** on the next line is <u>only</u> used if you want to <u>override</u> the email and phone associated with the automatically assigned group and/or user in the previous step. If this is left blank, the notifications will use the contact information available on the profile settings for the user(s) that match the workgroup and/or assignment settings.


- **Email Template** lets you override the default email template in the system and send a customized message for notifications from this process. 

  Click the **expand** icon to select from available templates. Click the name of the template you wish to use. To see the details of any template’s contents click the expand icon to its right.

![ATR16 Selectemailtemplate Jp](/images/AutomationTaskRules/ATR16-selectemailtemplate.jpg)

![ATR17 Editing Email Template Jp](/images/AutomationTaskRules/ATR17-EditingEmailTemplate.jpg)

- When you scroll to the bottom of the message template’s setup, you will see several action buttons:

![ATR18 Emailtemplateactions Jp](/images/AutomationTaskRules/ATR18-emailtemplateactions.jpg)

<Warning>
  **NOTE**: If you make changes to a template listed here, those changes will apply in ALL processes or tasks where this email template is used. **It is strongly recommended that you start by DUPLICATING the email template if you are changing or testing new content. This will avoid making a global change across all processes where a common email is used.**
</Warning>

- **Edit** unlocks the fields in the setup to allow you to make changes to them.


- **Test** validates the changes that you’ve made to a template to ensure that it doesn’t generate any errors when used to send an email.
- **Duplicate** creates a copy of this email template that you can then use as the basis for new content. This is the preferred process to use when you don’t want to make a global change across all processes where a common email is used or you are testing significant changes to content.
- **Delete** removes the template from the system and from all processes using it. 
- **Cancel** returns to the previous screen without saving any changes.
- The blue clock icon on the left shows the full editing **history** of this template. 
- You can also create a new email template by clicking the plus icon at the top right of the window.

**Message Template** works just like Email Template, but is used for SMS and WhatsApp messaging.

<Info>
  **More detail on creating and managing email and messaging templates is \
  found in the Administration Guide (COMING SOON).**
</Info>

- The final section is **Data Fields**. This is where you specify fields that may be referenced explicitly and included in the Email and Messaging templates (default or otherwise). **All fields used within the email or messaging template must be specified here or the data will not be available when the process runs.** **If you do not specify a field here and it is called within the template that field will be left blank in the messaging.**
  - In Edit mode, click the green plus sign to the right of Data Fields to begin selecting fields.\
    ![ATR19 Editingdatafieldsformessages Jp](/images/AutomationTaskRules/ATR19-editingdatafieldsformessages.jpg)
  - Click the **select** icon to choose from the available data fields. Click the name of the field to make it available. 
    - Field lists can be long. Use the **Search** at the top right to find the field you want.
    - Note that <u>the list may contain multiple pages</u>. Use the navigation at the bottom right to adjust the number of entries you see per page and to move between pages.\
      ![ATR20 Searchandpaginatedatafields Jp](/images/AutomationTaskRules/ATR20-searchandpaginatedatafields.jpg)
    - Click the green plus to add more data fields. 
    - After adding fields, you can change the order in which they are listed by using the move icon to drag them into the desired order. This does not affect processing in any way; it’s simply for your convenience in referencing them.

    ### **_User Task Settings_**

    User task settings differ from the global task settings in a few key ways:
    - They apply <u>only</u> to items within the specified task and process.
    - They do not allow for any settings relating to error handling.

    In the list of tasks, click a user task to expand its management view.
